## How to use this tool
1. Either clone this repo and compile the code using visual studio or download a prebuild executable **directly** from this github repo.
    - Make sure to check the MD5 of the executable after download the prebuild executable.
2. Either put this tool in the root folder of the BDO or you will have to manually select the BDO root folder.
3. Wait until the tool gets the most recent language file version data.
4. Double click the language file you want to replace to.
5. Choose the default language of your current game client.
6. Start the BDO launcher either from the tool or on your own. (Notice that if you purchased the game from steam, make sure the corresponding checkbox is checked)
7. Login to the BDO launcher and wait for the update to finish.
8. Click the Replace button in the tool.
9. Start the game.
10. Happy gaming!

## Cache system

The tool saves your last selection. So once you completed step 4 to 8 one time, the next time the tool will directly select it for you, and you just need to do step 6 and 8.
